# üß© Components Overview
Button Component (components/button.tsx)
This component accepts a name prop and renders a button with the provided name.

```
"use client";
import React from "react";

const button = (props: { name?: string }) => {
  console.log("Props ===>", props);
  return <div>{props.name}</div>;
};

export default button;
```

# Home Page (app/page.tsx)
The Home page uses the button component to display various button options, demonstrating the reusable nature of the component. You can customize the button text by passing the name prop.

```
import button from "../../components/button";

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <button name="Subscribe" />
      <button name="Follow me" />
      <button name="My Youtube Channel" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Home;
```
